# Can we predict revenue & venue capacity utilization?

Data exploration of Ticketmaster tour data

**Jupyter notebook:** https://github.com/cheeseinvert/tour-data-eda/blob/main/prompt_IV.ipynb

## Research Question:

Using available live event ticket sales data, can we create a predictive model to allow live event tour planners to accurately predict tour revenue and or venue capacity utilization for new tours?

## Data Source:

Ticketmaster US and Canada live event tour data (Artist Name, Event Date, Venue, City, Country, Revenue, Estimated Capacity, and Tickets Sold)

touringdata.org allows access to this data via year-specific master documents from 2024 onward via the Patreon link: https://www.patreon.com/c/touringdataLinks to an external site.

### Techniques to Be Used:

Feature correlation analysis and hyper-parameter grid search and cross-validation will be applied to a set of predictive modeling techniques discussed in this program, like linear regression, to discover feature importance and compare accuracy scores.

## Expected Results:

I expect the answer to the research question is yes, using combinations of dependent features like Event Date, Artist Name, Venue, City and Country that we will be able to generate a reasonably accurate predictive model of expected revenue and venue capacity utilization.

## Importance of the Question:

There are many factors that drive the costs of operation for a live event tour like venue & performance costs, travel & logistics, etc. Being able to accurately predict revenue and attendance are key to allow for successful tour planning. Live event tour planners must generate financially sustainable schedules for performers to meet goals of both bottom-line revenue generation and exhibition to the largest number of event attendees in the most efficient manner.
